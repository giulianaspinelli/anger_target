btw  the 'new' multipleformsupport is an ugly copy-paste of 'formsupportimpl' mostly due to  the fact that _cycle is private in formsupportimpl making it protected saves more that 750 lines... the other solution is for the subclass to also keep a copy of that field  when it's passed in the contructor - still ugly!
